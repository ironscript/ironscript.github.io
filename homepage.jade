		Ironscript is a minimal LISP like programming language implemented in Javascript.
		It is interpreted and the interpreter is written in ES2015. Currently we have an 
		<strong>interpreter</strong> that runs on browser and nodejs environments and a 
		<strong>bundler</strong> to bundle ironscript modules into .js files for the browser.

			dl
				dt 
					strong.subtitle.is-5.green-text.text-darken-4 LISP and Javascript Mixed.
				dd. 
					Ironscript is essentially an S-Expression evaluator written in Javascript. 
					This evaluator can use functions written Javascript and interact with the 
					JS environment at runtime through those functions. In fact you can write 
					Javascript functions inside your Ironscript S-Expressions using a simple API.
							
				dt
					strong.subtitle.is-5.green-text.text-darken-4 Functional.
				dd. 
					Ironscript is essentially a LISP over JS, every valid Ironscript statement / 
					expression / program is an <strong>S-Expression</strong>. You will be writing 
					mostly functions and streams to express your logic in Ironscript.
							
				dt
					strong.subtitle.is-5.green-text.text-darken-4 Better suited for expressing Asynchronous data flows.
				dd.
					The S-Expression <strong>evaluator is written in CPS (Continuation Passing Style)</strong>.  
					Therefore it's a tiny bit slower than synchronous Javascript. But it enables the 
					programmer to express complex asynchronous data and control flows linearly.

				dt
					strong.subtitle.is-5.green-text.text-darken-4 Modular, Easy to Learn, Use and Extend.
				dd.
					Ironscript provides an easy-syntax module in the standard library (stdlib), 
					that provides some frequently used syntactial abstractions as pattern rewriting 
					rules. Ironscript also provides an easy construct for defining pattern rewrite rules.
							
				dt
					strong.subtitle.is-5.green-text.text-darken-4 Free and OpenSource
				dd. 
					Free as in 'freedom'. Ironscript is licensed 
					<a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php">MIT</a> 
					and the source is hosted on github.

			h3.subtitle.is-3.red-text.text-darken-3.has-text-centered Ironscript IS NOT
			dl
				dt
					strong.subtitle.is-5.red-text.text-darken-4 CommonLISP or Scheme or ...
				dd.
					Ironscript is a LISP with its own syntactical conventions. Ironscript is 
					not designed to be pure LISP or Pure Javascript. It's designed to be minimal, 
					easily extendable and suitable for <strong>Rapid Prototyping</strong> 
					of applications. Its design goals are not syntactical or theoretical purity. 
					We are more concerned about simplicity and extensibility.
							
				dt
					strong.subtitle.is-5.red-text.text-darken-4 Compiled to Javascript. 
					emph.subtitle.is-5 (But will be)
				dd.
					Currently we do not have an Ironscript to JS transpiler. We do hope to have 
					a decent Optimizing Compiler to JS from v1.3 onwards. Currently there is a lot of 
					room for optimizations to be exploited, the interpretation is reasonably fast but 
					with an Optimizing Compiler we can generate better Javascript.
							
				dt
					strong.subtitle.is-5.red-text.text-darken-4 Limited to the Browserland
				dd.
					Ironscript can run 'literally' anywhere, where Javascript can run. That includes 
					servers via NodeJS, mobile applications via Cordova / PhoneGap. And as for the browser, 
					<strong>this website is written in Ironscript</strong>. Ironscript has been tested on Cordova too.

				dt
					strong.subtitle.is-5.red-text.text-darken-4 Stable Yet.
				dd.
					As of March 2017 (i.e. when this webpage was written), all these 'we' in this 
					document is a single person. Therefore the pace of development is slow and the 
					design goals are driven by the needs of an individual. 
					<strong>Contribute to make it better and more stable</strong>.

		p. 
			The following is the <strong>source code of this website</strong>. Do we, all of us, not love 
			<em>Quines</em> ? Here you can see a <strong>VirtualDOM</strong> implemented in Ironscript 
			using source code level Javascript embedding. You can also see how the code is neatly organized into 
			modules. Though the sourcecode is largely uncommented, it's fairly readable.

		h2.title.is-3.has-text-centered Get Started
		
		h5.subtitle.is-4 Installation with NPM
		p.
			Ironscript is can be installed using npm. The package adds 2 commands to the terminal, <b><code>ironscript</code></b> and 
			<b><code>ibun</code></b>. It's recommended to install the package globally by using the <b><code>-g</code></b> flag. You may have to 
			use sudo for installation on Linux depending on your permissions.
		pre.has-text-centered
			code npm install -g ironscript
					
		h5.subtitle.is-4 Doing the Hello World !
		p.
			First check the Hello World example in the Try It Online section, create a file named hello.is on your system, write the code and
			run <b><code>ironscript hello.is</code></b> from your terminal. It's that easy, really. We do not have an REPL yet, we hope to have 
			implemented an REPL by version 1.3 .
