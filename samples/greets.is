_module "Greeting Somebody"
    ; We will use easy-syntax provided in stdlib for better
    ; readability and demonstrate the module usage as well :)

    ; that's how you use the standard library
    (_use "stdlib")
    
    ; Let's start with a simple "Hello somebody" function
    [defun greet (name) 
        (_print "Hello " name) 
    ]

    (greet "John Doe")
